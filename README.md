# Mastering Ethereum Function Selectors

This code is from the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@cryptojesperk

This repository provides various examples demonstrating the use of function selectors in Solidity and Yul. Function selectors are crucial for identifying and invoking functions within Ethereum smart contracts. The examples include basic usage, advanced scenarios, hash collision handling, low-level calls, and interfaces. Additionally, a Python script is provided to compute function selectors for given function signatures. These examples aim to educate developers on the practical applications and nuances of function selectors in smart contract development.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jesperkristensen58/FunctionSelector.git
    cd FunctionSelector
    ```

2. **Compile and deploy the contracts** using your preferred Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).

3. **Interact with the contracts**:
    - Use the provided Solidity examples to understand function selectors and their applications.
    - Run the Python script to compute function selectors for your own function signatures.
